ðŸŽ¤ Slide 1: Intended User of the Application (30 seconds)
"Our dashboard targets two primary users. First, data science job seekers, especially Masters students approaching graduation who need market insights. Second, HR professionals who need to benchmark data science roles.
The main challenge was balancing analytical depth with accessibility. Looking at our dashboard, you can see we solved this through interactive visualizations that present complex data in an intuitive interface - from key metrics at the top to detailed trends below. Users can filter across multiple dimensions like location, salary, and job type to get personalized insights relevant to their specific situation."
ðŸŽ¤ Slide 2: Decision-Making Needs of the User (1 minute)
"For job seekers, we identified three critical decision areas: understanding competitive salary ranges shown in our salary trend chart, identifying which companies are actively hiring shown in our top companies visualization, and determining which locations offer the most opportunities as displayed in our geographic distribution chart.
For recruiters, we focused on competitive salary benchmarking, tracking the prevalence of remote work through our remote vs. office distribution visualization, and monitoring evolving job requirements like degree requirements and health insurance offerings.
Our most significant challenge was selecting which metrics would provide actionable insights. We overcame this by structuring the dashboard hierarchically - starting with key metrics at the top (total jobs, average salary) and allowing progressive exploration through the various charts below.
The Data Visualization course helped us design effective charts that tell a story, while our Database Systems course guided our approach to efficiently querying and aggregating the job data across multiple dimensions."
ðŸŽ¤ Slide 3: Data Validation and Preparation (1 minute)
"We started with a global Kaggle dataset containing jobs across all domains. After examining the raw data, we implemented a multi-stage pipeline to filter for data science positions in the USA, clean inconsistent formatting, and standardize fields for analysis.
One major challenge was normalizing salary information that appeared in different formats - hourly, yearly, or ranges. We created algorithms to convert everything to yearly salaries for consistent comparison, which you can see in our salary trend visualization.
We also enriched the data with derived attributes like remote work status, health insurance mentions, and degree requirements - creating dedicated visualizations for each that reveal important patterns. For example, our 'No Degree Mentioned' donut chart shows how many roles explicitly mention not requiring degrees, an important signal for job seekers considering alternative education paths."
ðŸŽ¤ Slide 4: Design of User Interface (1 minute)
"Our UI design prioritizes progressive information discovery. The dashboard begins with four key metric cards showing total jobs, unique companies, average salary, and new postings - providing immediate context.
Below these, we implemented a monthly trend chart showing posting volume over time, followed by categorical breakdowns for schedule types, locations, and companies. The data table at the top provides granular job details for users who want to explore specific listings.
Our biggest challenge was organizing these visualizations coherently. We iterated through multiple layouts, ultimately creating a flow that moves from overview metrics to specific dimensions. We consistently applied color coding - notice how the remote vs. office charts use the same color scheme throughout the dashboard to maintain visual consistency.
User testing revealed that filtering capabilities were essential, so we added controls at the top to filter by location, schedule type, and other key attributes, allowing for personalized analysis."
ðŸŽ¤ Slide 5: Final Reflection (Part 1 â€“ 1 minute 45 seconds)
"This project taught us valuable lessons about building data-driven applications. Initially, we planned to create a full-featured job platform, but through feasibility assessment, we narrowed our focus to an analytics dashboard delivering actionable insights.
For teamwork, we leveraged our complementary skills effectively. I focused on building the dashboard components and API endpoints, while my teammates handled data preparation, database optimization, and testing. This division allowed us to work in parallel and integrate our components seamlessly.
Learning job market analytics required studying existing platforms and their approaches to data presentation. We analyzed how platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed structure their insights and adapted these patterns to our specific data science focus.
What worked well was our iterative development approach - building core visualizations first, then enhancing them based on user feedback. What didn't work initially was our data architecture - we struggled with query performance when generating complex aggregations for the charts. We ultimately restructured our database approach to pre-aggregate certain metrics, significantly improving dashboard performance."
ðŸŽ¤ Slide 6: Final Reflection (Part 2 â€“ 1 minute 45 seconds)
"Personally, this project revealed strengths and weaknesses in my approach to technical challenges. I discovered I excel at translating data insights into visual representations but sometimes struggle with estimating the complexity of data preparation tasks.
As a team, we dramatically improved our ability to scope features realistically. Early on, we underestimated the challenges of cleaning inconsistent job listing data, particularly standardizing company names and locations that appeared in different formats across listings.
The most valuable lesson was learning to distinguish between technically impressive features and genuinely useful ones. Our initial dashboard had more complex visualizations, but user testing showed that simpler charts with clear takeaways were more valuable than technically sophisticated but difficult-to-interpret visualizations.
These lessons directly apply to my career aspirations in data science and analytics. I now understand that effective data products must balance technical accuracy with interpretability, and that clean, consistent data is the foundation of any successful analytics project. Whether working in a startup or enterprise environment, I'll bring these principles of user-centered design and data quality to every project I undertake."

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22.14.0)
- PostgreSQL (v16)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amogha009/job-network-app.git
cd job-network-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
# Create a .env.local file with the following variables
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/job-app
JWT_SECRET=super-secure-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

4. Database Schema:
   Ensure your PostgreSQL database has the `data_jobs` table. You can use the schema defined in `migrations/2025-05-18.sql`:
   ```sql
   -- (Include CREATE TABLE statement here or reference the file)
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data_jobs (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       job_title_short VARCHAR(50),
       job_title TEXT,
       job_location TEXT,
       job_via TEXT,
       job_schedule_type VARCHAR(50),
       job_work_from_home BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
       search_location TEXT NOT NULL,
       job_posted_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
       job_no_degree_mention BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
       job_health_insurance BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
       job_country VARCHAR(100),
       salary_rate VARCHAR(20),
       salary_year_avg FLOAT,
       salary_hour_avg FLOAT,
       company_name TEXT,
       job_skills TEXT,
       job_type_skills TEXT
   );
   ```
   _Note: You might need to populate this table with your dataset._

## Usage

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Navigate to `/dashboard` to view the data visualizations.

## System Architecture

- **Framework:** Next.js App Router for routing, server components, and client components.
- **Frontend:** React components built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for styling. Recharts for data visualization.
- **Backend:** Next.js Route Handlers process API requests, interact with the database using `node-postgres` (or your chosen library).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL stores the job data.

## Database Design

The primary table used for the dashboard is `data_jobs` (schema detailed in Installation section).

## API Endpoints

Key API endpoints for the dashboard include:

- `GET /api/datatable?page={page}&limit={limit}&search={search_term}&startDate={date}&endDate={date}&location={location}&schedule={schedule_type}&minSalary={number}&maxSalary={number}` - Retrieves paginated job data for the table.
- `GET /api/cards?startDate={date}&endDate={date}&search={search_term}&location={location}&schedule={schedule_type}&minSalary={number}&maxSalary={number}` - Fetches aggregated data for the summary cards.
- `GET /api/chart?startDate={date}&endDate={date}&search={search_term}&location={location}&schedule={schedule_type}&minSalary={number}&maxSalary={number}` - Gets monthly job posting counts for the main area chart.

## Deployment

The application is deployed as a single Next.js project.

1. Connect your GitHub repository to your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, AWS Amplify).
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `yarn build`
   - Publish directory: `.next` (standard for Next.js)
3. Set up environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard (refer to `.env.local` for required variables).
4. Ensure your hosting provider is configured for serverless functions to support Next.js API routes.
